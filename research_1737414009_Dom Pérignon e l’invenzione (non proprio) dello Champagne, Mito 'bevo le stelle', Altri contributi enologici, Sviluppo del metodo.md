### Comprehensive Report on Dom Pérignon, the Invention of Champagne, and the Development of the Champagne Method

#### 1. **Dom Pérignon and the Myth of the Invention of Champagne**
   - **Dom Pérignon's Role**: Dom Pérignon, a Benedictine monk, is often mistakenly credited with inventing Champagne. However, historical records indicate that he did not invent sparkling wine. Instead, he focused on improving the quality of still wines in the Champagne region. His contributions to viticulture and winemaking were significant, but his primary goal was to prevent bubbles from forming in the wine, as they were considered a flaw at the time.

   - **Key Contributions**: Dom Pérignon introduced several practices that are still used in modern winemaking, including:
     - **Severe Pruning**: To control vine growth and improve grape quality.
     - **Low Yields**: To ensure that the grapes were of the highest quality.
     - **Careful Harvesting**: To select only the best grapes for winemaking.
     - **Blending**: He was one of the first to blend grapes from different vineyards to create a more complex and balanced wine.

   - **The Myth of Dom Pérignon**: The myth that Dom Pérignon invented Champagne likely spread after his death, embellished by Dom Grossard, the last bursar of the Abbey of Hautvillers. Modern Champagne producers have also promoted the idea of Dom Pérignon as a founder figure to enhance the prestige of their brands.

#### 2. **The Mito 'Bevo le Stelle'**
   - **Cultural Significance**: The phrase "Bevo le stelle" (I drink the stars) is often associated with the experience of drinking Champagne, symbolizing the effervescence and luxury of the wine. However, this phrase is more of a poetic expression rather than a historical fact tied to Dom Pérignon or the invention of Champagne.
     - **Note**: The search did not yield specific historical references to this phrase in the context of Dom Pérignon or Champagne.

#### 3. **Other Enological Contributions by Dom Pérignon**
   - **Innovations in Winemaking**: Dom Pérignon's work laid the foundation for many modern winemaking techniques. His experiments with fermentation and blending were pioneering, and his focus on quality over quantity set a standard for future winemakers.

   - **Introduction of Strong Bottles and Cork Closures**: In the 1690s, Dom Pérignon introduced strong "English glass" bottles and reintroduced the use of cork as a closure, which were essential for containing the pressure of sparkling wine.

#### 4. **Development of the Champagne Method**
   - **Historical Context**: The Champagne method, also known as the traditional method or méthode champenoise, involves a second fermentation in the bottle, which creates the characteristic bubbles. This method was not invented by Dom Pérignon but was developed over time, with contributions from various winemakers.

   - **Christopher Merret and the Invention of Sparkling Wine**: English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper to the Royal Society in 1662, describing how to create sparkling wine by adding sugar to still wine to induce a second fermentation. This method was already being used by English cidermakers before it was adopted in Champagne.

   - **Evolution of the Champagne Method**: The traditional method involves several key steps:
     1. **Primary Fermentation**: The base wine is fermented in tanks or barrels.
     2. **Blending**: Wines from different vineyards and vintages are blended to create a consistent cuvée.
     3. **Secondary Fermentation**: The blended wine is bottled with a mixture of sugar and yeast, initiating a second fermentation that produces carbon dioxide, creating the bubbles.
     4. **Aging on Lees**: The wine is aged in the bottle for an extended period, allowing it to develop complex flavors.
     5. **Riddling**: The bottles are gradually tilted and rotated to collect the yeast sediment in the neck of the bottle.
     6. **Disgorging**: The sediment is removed, and the bottle is topped up with a dosage (a mixture of wine and sugar) before being sealed with a cork.

#### 5. **Fun Facts**
   - **Dom Pérignon's Legacy**: The Dom Pérignon brand, launched by Moët & Chandon in 1936, is one of the most prestigious Champagne brands in the world. It was the first Champagne marketed as a prestige cuvée.

   - **Champagne Bottles**: The modern Dom Pérignon bottle is similar in design to the original 18th-century Champagne bottles, reflecting the timeless elegance of the brand.

   - **Champagne and Hollywood**: Champagne has long been associated with luxury and celebration. Marilyn Monroe famously bathed in Champagne, and James Bond often used his knowledge of Champagne vintages to impress his adversaries.
