#### Tuscany
Tuscany is one of Italy's most famous wine regions, known for its noble reds and the development of the "Supertuscan" wines. The Antinori family, one of the most important wine producers in Italy, has a significant presence in Tuscany. Their portfolio includes several prestigious estates:

Puglia, located in the southern part of Italy, is known for its warm climate and calcareous soils, which are ideal for producing robust and fruity wines. The Antinori family has also expanded into Puglia with their **Tormaresca** estate, a large-scale operation that produces high-quality wines.

Sicily, with its volcanic soils and warm climate, is another important wine region in Italy. The island is known for its native grape varieties like Inzolia and Nero d'Avola. The Antinori family has invested in Sicily, recognizing the region's potential for producing premium wines. Sicily's wineries benefit from consistent quality year after year, making it an attractive region for investment by major Italian wine producers.

#### Friuli
Friuli, located in the northeastern part of Italy, is renowned for its white wines, particularly those made from the Tocai Friulano grape. The region's calcareous soils and favorable climate contribute to the production of high-quality wines.
