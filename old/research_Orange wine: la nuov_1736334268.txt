### Comprehensive Report on Orange Wine: Skin-Contact Wines, Amber Color, and Natural Approach

#### Introduction
Orange wine, also known as skin-contact wine or amber wine, is a unique style of wine that has gained popularity in recent years, particularly among natural wine enthusiasts. Unlike traditional white wines, which are made by fermenting grape juice without the skins, Orange wine is produced by fermenting white grape juice with the skins and seeds, similar to red winemaking. This process results in a wine with a distinctive amber or orange hue, higher tannin levels, and a more complex flavor profile.

#### Skin-Contact Fermentation
The defining characteristic of Orange wine is its production method, which involves extended skin-contact fermentation. This process allows the juice to remain in contact with the grape skins, seeds, and sometimes stems for an extended period, ranging from a few days to several months. The prolonged maceration extracts phenolic compounds, tannins, and flavor precursors from the skins, contributing to the wine's color, structure, and complexity.

- **Extraction Process**: The extraction of phenolic compounds during skin-contact fermentation is crucial for developing the wine's color and tannin structure. These compounds also contribute to the wine's oxidative stability and aging potential.
- **Vessel Types**: Traditional methods often involve fermenting the wine in clay amphorae or qvevri, which are large, egg-shaped vessels buried underground. These vessels allow for natural temperature regulation and minimal intervention, aligning with the natural winemaking philosophy.
- **Flavor Profile**: The extended skin contact imparts flavors that are more akin to red wines, with notes of dried fruits, nuts, and spices. The tannins from the skins add a textural element that is uncommon in traditional white wines.

#### Amber Color
The amber or orange color of these wines is a direct result of the extended skin contact during fermentation. The phenolic compounds extracted from the skins, particularly flavonoids, contribute to the wine's color, which can range from pale yellow to deep amber or even pink, depending on the grape variety, ripeness, and duration of maceration.

- **Color Development**: The color of Orange wine is influenced by several factors, including the grape variety, the length of skin contact, and the type of fermentation vessel used. For example, wines fermented in clay amphorae may develop a deeper amber hue due to the oxidative environment.
- **Oxidation**: Unlike traditional white wines, which are often protected from oxidation to preserve their fresh, fruity characteristics, Orange wines may undergo controlled oxidation during fermentation and aging. This can enhance the wine's complexity and contribute to its amber color.

#### Natural Winemaking Approach
Orange wine is closely associated with the natural wine movement, which emphasizes minimal intervention in both the vineyard and the winery. This approach often includes organic or biodynamic farming practices, spontaneous fermentation using native yeasts, and the avoidance of additives such as sulfur dioxide.

- **Organic and Biodynamic Practices**: Many producers of Orange wine adhere to organic or biodynamic farming methods, which prioritize soil health and biodiversity. These practices are believed to enhance the expression of terroir in the wine.
- **Spontaneous Fermentation**: The use of native yeasts for fermentation is a hallmark of natural winemaking. This approach allows for a more diverse microbial ecosystem, which can contribute to the wine's unique flavor profile.
- **Minimal Additives**: Natural winemakers often avoid or minimize the use of additives, including sulfur dioxide, which is commonly used as a preservative in conventional winemaking. This can result in wines that are more expressive of their raw materials but may also be less stable and more prone to oxidation.

#### Historical Context and Revival
While Orange wine has gained recent popularity, its production methods are not new. The practice of fermenting white grapes with their skins dates back thousands of years, particularly in the Caucasus region, where qvevri winemaking has been a tradition for millennia. The modern revival of Orange wine can be attributed to pioneering winemakers in Friuli, Italy, such as Stanko Radikon and Josko Gravner, who reintroduced these ancient techniques in the late 20th century.

- **Ancient Techniques**: The use of qvevri for fermenting and aging wine is a traditional method that has been practiced in Georgia for thousands of years. This method involves burying large clay vessels underground, where the wine ferments and ages in contact with the skins, seeds, and stems.
- **Modern Revival**: In the late 1990s and early 2000s, winemakers in Friuli began experimenting with extended skin-contact fermentation, inspired by these ancient techniques. Their efforts led to the creation of a new category of wine, which was later coined "Orange wine" by UK wine merchant David Harvey in 2004.

#### Fun Facts
- **Name Origin**: The term "Orange wine" was coined in 2004 by David Harvey, a UK wine merchant, while tasting skin-contact wines on Mount Etna in Sicily. The name refers to the wine's amber or orange hue, which is a result of the extended skin contact during fermentation.
- **Qvevri Tradition**: The use of qvevri for fermenting and aging wine is a tradition that dates back over 8,000 years in Georgia. These large clay vessels are buried underground, where the wine ferments and ages in contact with the skins, seeds, and stems, resulting in a unique flavor profile.
- **Natural Wine Movement**: Orange wine is often associated with the natural wine movement, which emphasizes minimal intervention in both the vineyard and the winery. This includes organic or biodynamic farming practices, spontaneous fermentation using native yeasts, and the avoidance of additives such as sulfur dioxide.

#### Conclusion
Orange wine represents a fascinating intersection of ancient winemaking traditions and modern natural wine practices. Its distinctive amber color, complex flavor profile, and higher tannin levels set it apart from traditional white wines, making it a unique and intriguing option for wine enthusiasts. As the natural wine movement continues to grow, Orange wine is likely to remain a popular choice for those seeking wines that are expressive of their terroir and produced with minimal intervention.
