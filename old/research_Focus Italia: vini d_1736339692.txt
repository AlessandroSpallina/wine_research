### Comprehensive Report on Focus Italia: Vini dell’Etna, tra Vulcani e Mare

#### 1. **Volcanic Soil of Etna**
The volcanic soils of Mount Etna are a key factor in the unique character of Etna wines. These soils are rich in allophane clays, which have excellent water-storing properties, providing vines with much-needed moisture during the dry summer months. The soils also contain loam, making them more fertile than typical volcanic soils. The composition varies across the volcano, with the northern sector having 78% sand, 10% loam, and 12% clay, while the southern sector has 88% sand, 4% loam, and 8% clay. The color of the soil ranges from gray-brown to black, depending on the age and composition of the lava flows. The locals refer to the small pieces of pumice as *ripiddu*, which contribute to excellent drainage. The soils are low in nitrogen and calcium but have moderate potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels, with high concentrations of iron and copper.

#### 2. **Etna DOC**
The Etna DOC, established in 1968, covers vineyards on the north, east, and south sides of Mount Etna. The region is divided into *contrade* (districts), each with its own unique terroir. The DOC produces high-quality red, white, rosé, and sparkling wines. The red wines are primarily made from Nerello Mascalese, often blended with Nerello Cappuccio, while the white wines are dominated by Carricante. The Etna Superiore designation applies only to the commune of Milo, known for its exceptional white wines. The region has seen a surge in popularity since the early 2000s, with the number of producers doubling between 2011 and 2020.

#### 3. **Carricante**
Carricante is one of Italy's greatest native white grape varieties, known for producing wines with high acidity, minerality, and longevity. The name "Carricante" refers to its high productivity, as it can "load up" carts with grapes if left unchecked. However, when properly managed, it yields wines of exceptional quality. Carricante thrives at high altitudes (700–1,050 meters above sea level) on the eastern and southern slopes of Etna, where it benefits from cooler temperatures and abundant rainfall. The best Carricante wines come from the *contrada* of Caselle in Milo, where old vines produce wines with a lemony, flinty character. Etna Bianco Superiore, made with at least 80% Carricante, is considered the pinnacle of white wines from the region.

#### 4. **Nerello Mascalese**
Nerello Mascalese is the star red grape of Etna, often compared to Pinot Noir for its ability to express terroir and its pale, elegant wines. It is typically blended with Nerello Cappuccio, which adds color and softens the acidity. Nerello Mascalese wines are known for their aromas of sour red cherry, tobacco, and aromatic herbs, with a mineral undertone. The grape thrives at lower altitudes (below 800 meters) and prefers warmer conditions, making it well-suited to the northern and eastern slopes of Etna. The variety has seen a resurgence in popularity, with many producers focusing on single-vineyard bottlings that highlight the unique characteristics of each *contrada*.

#### 5. **Fun Facts**
- **Volcanic Resilience**: Etna's vineyards survived phylloxera because the pest cannot thrive in volcanic soils. Many of the vines are pre-phylloxeric, making them some of the oldest in the world.
- **Carricante's Longevity**: Carricante wines can age for over a decade, developing complex aromas of diesel fuel, lemon, and green apple, similar to aged Riesling.
- **Nerello Mascalese's DNA**: DNA profiling has revealed that Nerello Mascalese is a cross between Sangiovese and Mantonico Bianco, linking it to other famous Italian varieties like Gaglioppo.
- **Etna's Microclimates**: The diurnal temperature variation on Etna can exceed 30°C in the summer, with the dark volcanic soils absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night, creating a unique microclimate for viticulture.
