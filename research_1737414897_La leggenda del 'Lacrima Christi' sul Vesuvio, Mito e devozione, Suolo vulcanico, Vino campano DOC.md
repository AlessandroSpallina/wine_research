### Comprehensive Report on La Leggenda del 'Lacrima Christi' sul Vesuvio, Mito e Devozione, Suolo Vulcanico, Vino Campano DOC

#### 1. The Legend of Lacrima Christi (Tears of Christ)
The legend of Lacrima Christi is deeply rooted in the religious and cultural history of Mount Vesuvius. According to the myth, when Lucifer was cast out of Heaven, he tore away a piece of paradise, which fell to Earth and created the Bay of Naples. Upon seeing this, Jesus wept, and his tears fell onto the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, giving birth to the vineyards that produce Lacrima Christi wine. This story has been passed down through generations and is a testament to the deep connection between the land, the people, and their faith.

The name "Lacrima Christi" (Tears of Christ) is not only a reference to this legend but also to the tear-shaped berries of the grapes used in the wine. The wine itself is a symbol of devotion and has been cherished for centuries, with some historical accounts suggesting that it was a favorite of Emperor Federico Barbarossa in the 12th century.

#### 2. Myth and Devotion
The myth of Lacrima Christi is more than just a story; it is a reflection of the deep spiritual connection that the people of Campania have with their land. The volcanic soil of Mount Vesuvius, which is said to have been blessed by the tears of Christ, is considered sacred. This belief has fostered a sense of devotion among the local winemakers, who see their work as a form of worship.

The wine is often associated with religious ceremonies and is sometimes used in the Eucharist, further cementing its spiritual significance. The legend has also inspired a sense of pride and identity among the people of Campania, who view Lacrima Christi as a symbol of their heritage and faith.

#### 3. Volcanic Soil of Mount Vesuvius
The volcanic soil of Mount Vesuvius is one of the most unique terroirs in the world. The soil is rich in minerals, particularly sulfur, which is naturally found in the volcanic ash and lava that have shaped the landscape over millennia. This mineral-rich soil imparts a distinct character to the wines produced in the region, giving them a unique flavor profile that is difficult to replicate elsewhere.

The volcanic soil also has a significant impact on the viticulture of the region. The porous nature of the soil allows for excellent drainage, which is crucial for the health of the vines. Additionally, the soil's high mineral content contributes to the high acidity levels in the grapes, which is a hallmark of Lacrima Christi wines. The combination of these factors results in wines that are fresh, crisp, and full of character.

#### 4. Campania DOC Region
The Campania DOC region is one of the most important wine-producing areas in Italy, known for its diverse range of indigenous grape varieties and high-quality wines. The region is divided into several subzones, each with its own unique terroir and winemaking traditions. The DOC Vesuvio, located on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, is particularly renowned for its Lacrima Christi wines.

The DOC Vesuvio is characterized by its volcanic soils, which are ideal for growing the Caprettone, Falanghina, and Piedirosso grapes used in Lacrima Christi wines. The region has experienced a qualitative revival in recent years, with winemakers focusing on lower yields and higher-density vineyards to produce wines of exceptional quality.

Lacrima Christi wines from the Campania DOC region are known for their freshness, acidity, and complex flavor profiles. The white Lacrima Christi is typically made from Caprettone and Falanghina grapes, resulting in a wine that is crisp and aromatic, with notes of green apple and white flowers. The red Lacrima Christi, made from Piedirosso grapes, is known for its bright red berry flavors and delicate herbal notes.

#### 5. Fun Facts
- **Ancient Roots**: The Greco di Tufo grape, used in some Lacrima Christi wines, is believed to be one of the ancient Roman varieties, with locals claiming that it has been grown near Naples for centuries.
- **Volcanic Resilience**: The volcanic soils of Mount Vesuvius are so rich in minerals that phylloxera, a pest that devastated vineyards across Europe in the 19th century, cannot survive there. This has allowed the vines to grow on their own rootstocks, preserving their ancient genetic heritage.
- **Tear-Shaped Berries**: The name "Lacrima" (tear) comes from the tear-shaped berries of the grapes used in the wine, which are said to resemble the tears of Christ.
- **Historical Significance**: Lacrima Christi was a favorite of Emperor Federico Barbarossa in the 12th century, and its production has been documented in the writings of Italian ampelographers as far back as the 19th century.
