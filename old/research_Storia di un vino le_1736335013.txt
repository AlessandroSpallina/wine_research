### **Storia di un vino leggendario: la nascita dellâ€™Amarone. Valpolicella, drying process, sweet vs. dry history**  

#### **1. The Legend and History of Amarone**  
Amarone della Valpolicella, one of Italy's most iconic wines, has a fascinating history rooted in the Valpolicella region of Veneto. The name "Amarone" derives from the Italian word *amaro*, meaning "bitter," a nod to its dry, robust character. Historically, Amarone was not intentionally created but rather emerged as a "faulty" version of Recioto, a sweet wine made from dried grapes. Legend has it that Amarone was born when a batch of Recioto fermented to complete dryness, resulting in a wine with a rich, complex, and slightly bitter profile. This accidental discovery gained popularity, and by the 1950s, Amarone was being commercially produced. Today, it is celebrated as a symbol of Italian winemaking excellence.  

#### **2. The Valpolicella Region**  
The Valpolicella region, located in the Veneto foothills near Verona, is the heart of Amarone production. The name "Valpolicella" is derived from Latin and Greek, meaning "the valley of many cellars," reflecting its long winemaking tradition. The region's unique terroir, characterized by rolling hills, well-drained soils, and a temperate climate, is ideal for growing the indigenous grape varieties used in Amarone: Corvina, Corvinone, and Rondinella. These grapes thrive in the region's microclimates, which are influenced by the nearby Lake Garda and the Lessini Mountains.  

#### **3. The Drying Process (Appassimento)**  
The production of Amarone relies on the ancient technique of *appassimento*, a process of drying grapes to concentrate their sugars, flavors, and acidity. After harvest, the grapes are carefully selected and laid out on bamboo racks or plastic crates in well-ventilated drying rooms (*fruttai*). Traditionally, the grapes were dried in attics or lofts, but modern producers often use temperature- and humidity-controlled facilities to ensure consistency. The drying process lasts for 90 to 120 days, during which the grapes lose up to 40% of their weight, intensifying their flavors and increasing their sugar content. This process also allows for the development of noble rot (*Botrytis cinerea*) in some grapes, adding complexity to the wine.  

#### **4. Sweet vs. Dry: The Evolution of Amarone**  
Historically, the Valpolicella region was known for its sweet wines, particularly Recioto, which was made from partially dried grapes. Amarone emerged as a dry alternative when fermentation continued to completion, converting all the sugars into alcohol. Over time, Amarone gained recognition for its bold, dry profile, characterized by high alcohol content (often exceeding 15%), rich tannins, and flavors of dried fruit, chocolate, and spices. Today, Amarone is produced in both dry and sweet styles, but the dry version is the most celebrated and widely consumed.  

#### **5. Fun Facts**  
- **Amarone's Rise to Fame**: Amarone was not commercially produced until the 1950s, but its popularity skyrocketed in the 1980s, particularly in Scandinavia, Germany, and the United States.  
- **The Role of Noble Rot**: While Amarone is primarily made from healthy grapes, the presence of noble rot (*Botrytis cinerea*) during the drying process can enhance the wine's complexity, adding notes of honey and dried apricots.  
- **Amarone's Aging Potential**: Amarone is known for its exceptional aging potential. When stored properly, it can develop for decades, evolving into a wine of unparalleled depth and elegance.  

#### **Conclusion**  
Amarone della Valpolicella is a testament to the ingenuity and tradition of Italian winemaking. From its accidental origins to its meticulous production process, Amarone embodies the rich history and unique terroir of the Valpolicella region. Whether enjoyed in its classic dry style or its sweeter Recioto counterpart, Amarone continues to captivate wine lovers around the world with its bold flavors and legendary status.
